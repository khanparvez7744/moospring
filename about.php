      <p class="center">Moospring Farm formally enunciated operations in June 2019 at Greater
        Noida Pari Chowk India, is a pioneer and eminent parent brand of Mugdh Farm and Moo Farm. It has quite 200 cows
        on the board with a procurement of 45000 litres of milk per month. The farm is provided with the best
        international technology for feeding, milking and processing. We have fabricated a sustainable, environmentally
        and technologically advanced dairy that produces and parcel out the absolute best milk in terms of quality and
        purity.</p>
      <p class="center">Our mechanised dairy ambience and stringent procedures ensure that the
        milk is both hygienically and zero human touch procured. In fact, every cow goes through an electronic checkup
        whenever it's milked, to make sure that it's at peak health for milking. And we ensure that the fresh milk that
        is dispatched from the dairy is completely antibiotic free.</p>

    <p>The cows are nurtured with care and attention by a specially trained team of professionals. What we ingrain in our team is that it's not what we would like, but what the cows need. So from 24x7 on-demand supplies of food and water to rendering them their very own fans, sprinklers and sprays; from ensuring that milking isn't forced, to being nurtured by expert coaches and healthcare specialists, the cows receive adept loving care all the way.</p>
